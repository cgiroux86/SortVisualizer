# SortVisualizer
### Deployed Version: https://sort-visualizer.vercel.app/

## Project title

<!-- A little info about your project and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is about. -->

This project was designed to help users visually comprehend classic sorting algorithms.

## Motivation

Algorithms are fun! Ever since studying CS, I have fallen in love with studying and implementing algorithms to solve real life problems. Classic sorting algorithms are nothing new, neither are visualizations. However, you don't see many applications with the ability to compare these algorithms side by side. It was an excellent way to demonstrate real life problem solving using React and further my understanding of classic sorting algorithms.

## Tech/framework used


<b>Built with</b>

- React

## Features

- Ability for a user to see side by side comparison of classic sorting algorithms, including difference in speed between O(n \* log(n)) and O(n^2).

- User can select size and speed of sorting list and sorting speed, respectively.

- Single or Double view, depending on if you want to analyze or compare.
